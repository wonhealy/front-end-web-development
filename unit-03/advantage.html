        Practice with the Cascade. In this exercise, you will create two web pages that
         link to the same external style sheet. After modifying the configuration in the 
         external style sheet, you will test your pages again and find that 
         they automatically pick up the new style configuration. Finally,
          you will add an inline style to one of the pages and find that
           it takes effect and overrides the external style.
